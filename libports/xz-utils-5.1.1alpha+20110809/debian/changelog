xz-utils (5.1.1alpha+20110809-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * liblzma: Match upstream ABI.
    - Remove the lzma_chunk_size() function.
    - A few ABI tweaks to reserved space in structures.
    - Enable ELF symbol versioning.
    - Bump soname to 5.
    - Continue to leave out threading support, since the relevant
      interfaces in liblzma are not yet stable.
  * xz-utils/README.Debian: Remove note on ABI differences.
  * Remove liblzma/README.Debian.
  * liblzma: Introduce a lzma_code@Base compatibility symbol to ensure
    programs linked against unversioned symbols from liblzma2 can
    share a process image with liblzma5 without breaking.
  * debian/symbols: XZ_5.0 symbols come from liblzma5.  Build-Depends:
    dpkg-dev (>= 1.15.6); thanks to Jakub Wilk for a reminder.
  * debian/symbols: The lzma_code@Base symbol is not guaranteed to
    continue to exist in the future, so tell dpkg-shlibdeps to produce
    an error if some package manages to use it.

xz-utils (5.1.1alpha+20110809-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New snapshot, taken from upstream commit 5c5b225.
    - liblzma:
      - lzma_stream_encoder() leaked memory.
      - The LZMA2 decoder rejected streams that decompress to a
        zero-length string.
      - lzma_easy_buffer_encode() and lzma_stream_buffer_encode()
        used to write such streams when asked to compress a 0-length
        buffer.
      - lzma_index_init() would segfault on allocation failure.
      - liblzma: Various functions check their arguments (especially
        choice of integrity check) better, making it harder to create
        a corrupt .xz file instead of receiving an error.
    - xz and scripts:
      - "xz -v -v --list" would read and try to free() uninitialized
        memory, continuing past the end of an on-stack array, when
        asked to describe certain corrupted XZ files.
      - xz -S.suf now refuses to compress a file whose name already
        ends with the suffix “.suf”.
      - xz --force can be used to compress setuid, setgid, sticky,
        and multiply linked files.
      - xz uses posix_fadvise() to speed up sequential input.
      - xz --block-size forces a full flush periodically during
        compression, for better random-access reading support and to
        make simple parallelism possible in the future.
      - unxz: The new --single-stream option discards trailing
        garbage after the end of the first stream.
      - xzdiff can read gzip- and bzip2-compressed files.
      - xzdiff and xzgrep can read lzop-compressed files.
      - xzegrep and xzfgrep perform extended regex and fixed-string
        matches, respectively.  (The previous behavior was to always
        use basic regexes.)
      - xzgrep -l (= --files-with-match) works.
      - The Czech “xz --help” output uses a more correct term for
        files with holes.  Thanks to Petr Hubený.  Closes: #605762.
      - xz: New Polish and French translations.
    - The Doxygen-generated documentation uses short, relative paths
      to name source files.  Closes: #572273.
  * Update copyright file.
  * Remove example programs from debian/examples.  They are included
    in the upstream source package now.
  * Move liblzma to an architecture-specific directory, so the
    native library and foreign-architecture versions can be installed
    simultaneously.
    - liblzma2: Pre-Depends: multiarch-support.
    - Use debhelper compatibility level 9.  This requires passing
      the dh sequence name before other options when invoking dh in
      debian/rules.  Build-Depends: debhelper (>= 8.1.3).
    - liblzma2, liblzma-dev: Install files under /usr/lib/<triplet>
      instead of /usr/lib.
    - Thanks to Steve Langasek for explaining the process on the
      Debian wiki.
  * Standards-Version: 3.9.2 (checked).
  * debian/control: liblzma2 is Multi-Arch: same, while xz-utils
    and xzdec are Multi-Arch: foreign.  Closes: #637883.  Thanks to
    Riku Voipio.
  * debian/symbols: Bump the minimal version for LZMA2 encoder
    functions that reject more bad arguments and skip empty blocks.
  * debian/rules: ./configure --disable-symbol-versions for now.
  * debian/rules: Provide build-arch and build-indep targets that
    only build the code and the API documentation, respectively.
    Thanks to Roger Leigh for suggesting it through lintian.
    Build-Depends: debhelper (>= 8.9.0).
  * debian/rules: Treat DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS=nocheck as a request not to
    run build-time tests.  Thanks to Thorsten Glaser for a reminder.
    Closes: #627209.

xz-utils (5.0.0-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * Upload to experimental.
  * New stable upstream release.  Closes: #592298.
    - xz avoids SA_RESTART.  This should not have a visible effect
      because xz already blocked signals during operations that
      would be difficult to resume after interruption.
    - liblzma: The coders returned by lzma_index_encoder() and
      lzma_index_decoder() support an LZMA_FINISH action, with
      identical semantics to LZMA_RUN.
    - The printable (PDF and PS) versions of the manual are easier
      to read.
    - Many documentation and build system cleanups.
  * liblzma: Back out upstream ABI tweaks.
  * liblzma/README.Debian: Document ABI differences from upstream.
  * Copy sample code not included in the release tarball from
    the development upstream repository to debian/examples.
  * debian/rules clean: Remove some files not included in the

xz-utils (4.999.9beta+20100927-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New snapshot, taken from upstream commit cec0ddc.
    - liblzma: The meaning of --extreme has been tweaked to address
      cases in which it made the compression ratio worse.  Some files
      might benefit slightly less from --extreme.
    - xz: Table columns are not misaligned any more in messages with
      multi-byte characters (e.g., file sizes with LANG=fi_FI.UTF-8).
    - xz: New German and Italian translations.
    - Various documentation, message, and translation updates.

xz-utils (4.999.9beta+20100903-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New snapshot, taken from upstream commit 373ee26.
    - liblzma: The settings for compression levels 0 through 5
      (used by xz -0/.../-5) have been tweaked.  This affects the
      speed, compression ratio, and memory usage at compression and
      decompression time.
    - Does not search so hard for a match when a low "nice match
      length" setting is specified without a depth.
    - xz: The -1/.../-9 preset options override any previously
      specified filters, rather than vice versa.  To mix presets
      with filter options, use the --lzma2=preset=n option.
    - xz: Warns about --memlimit-compress settings that result in
      compression settings changing even if no explicit -1/.../-9,
      --lzma1, or --lzma2 option was used.
    - "xz -v -v --compress" now prints an estimate of the memory
      required to decompress a file.
  * debian/copyright: Update upstream Git URL.
  * debian/changelog.upstream.sh: Permit terser changelog lines.
  * Standards-Version: 3.9.1 (checked).

xz-utils (4.999.9beta+20100810-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream snapshot, taken from upstream commit d5653ba8a.
    - xz: The memory usage limiter is now disabled by default.
    - xz: Support for an XZ_DEFAULTS environment variable was added.
      It contains user-specific default settings, such as memory usage
      limits, and can be overridden by the command line and XZ_OPT.
    - xz: The new --memlimit-compress and --memlimit-decompress
      options allow the memory usage limit to be set separately for
      compression and decompression.  A new --memlimit alias has been
      added for the existing --memory option.
    - xz: The --info-memory option (with or without --robot) now prints
      how much RAM is installed in addition to the compression and
      decompression memory limits.
  * liblzma-doc: Simplify package description.
  * debian/control: Build-Depends: autopoint | gettext (<< 0.18-1),
    autopoint | cvs instead of autopoint, to help with backporting.
    Thanks to Thorsten Glaser for a report.

  * New upstream snapshot, taken from upstream commit f4b2b526.
    - liblzma: The stream initialization functions were not correctly
      initializing the internal allow_buffer_error flag.  As a result,
      ever since 4.999.9beta-1 in rare circumstances when decompressing
      LZMA files, the xz tool would produce spurious "Unexpected end
      of input" failures (Gentoo bug 305591).
    - The default memory usage limit on low-memory systems has been
      increased.

  * New upstream snapshot, taken from upstream commit eb7d51a3f.

xz-utils (4.999.9beta+20100117-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream snapshot, taken from upstream commit 07a11dad.
     + Fix some logic errors in the internal memory usage configuration
       API.
     + xz will no longer compress or decompress special files in place,
       even with --force.
       --force still enables compression of the target of a symlink.
     + xz will no longer read compressed data from a terminal or write
       it to a terminal, even with --force.
     + liblzma: many Index handling API improvements:
        - An lzma_index includes more useful metadata that is not
          actually from the Index.  This is particularly helpful for
          describing multiple-stream files.
           * lzma_index_cat() does not take a stream padding argument
             any more; use lzma_index_stream_padding() instead.
           * lzma_index_memusage() takes two arguments now.
             The new lzma_index_memused() convenience function
             calculates the total memory usage of an lzma_index.
           * lzma_index_count() has been replaced with
             lzma_index_block_count() and lzma_index_stream_count().
           * The new lzma_index_stream_flags() allows storing Stream
             Flags (e.g., checksum types) with the Index information.
           * The new lzma_index_checks() function indicates the list of
             checksum types in use.
           * lzma_index_equal() has been removed.  Its semantics were
             unclear, and something approximately equivalent can be
             implemented by iterating over Blocks in application code.
        - An lzma_index no longer represents a position within an Index.
          The new lzma_index_iter type can be used for that purpose.
           * Certain functions generate an iterator on demand now rather
             than clobbering their lzma_index arguments.  Using a single
             lzma_index for multiple concurrent invocations is safe now:
              lzma_index_buffer_encode(), lzma_index_encoder()
           * Functions that used to specify a Record by modifying an
             lzma_index argument have been renamed and taught to write
             an lzma_index_iter instead:
              lzma_index_locate() -> lzma_index_iter_locate()
              lzma_index_rewind() -> lzma_index_iter_rewind()
              lzma_index_read() -> lzma_index_iter_next()
           * The lzma_index_record type used by lzma_index_read() for
             complex seeks is no more.  lzma_index_iter_next() instead
             takes a parameter of the new lzma_index_iter_mode type.
           * New function: lzma_index_iter_init()
           * lzma_index_init() cannot reuse memory from an existing
             lzma_index any more.  The signature changed accordingly.
     + xz: support for decompressing to a sparse file
        - Try to write a sparse file if the decompressed stream contains
          long runs of null bytes.
        - The new --no-sparse option disables this behavior.
     + xz: add Czech translation.
     + liblzma-dev: lzma_filters_copy() and lzma_filters_update() are
       declared not to throw exceptions.
  * liblzma: bump soname.
  * xz-utils: Add NEWS.Debian describing the sparse file support.
  * debian/rules: Stop explicitly disabling assembler optimizations on
    the Hurd.  The configure script will check if a platform is
    supported.

  * debian/rules: Update clean target to handle comments and wildcards
    in .gitignore.
  * Build-Depends: perl.

  * debian/rules: Speed up build by using autoreconf --symlink.
  * Remove debian/dirs lists.
  * Update copyright file and fix a small typo.

  * Build xz-utils with static liblzma.
     - debian/rules: Use configure --enable-dynamic=mixed.
  * Optimize xzdec for size, following suggestion in PACKAGERS.
     - debian/rules: Build xzdec separately so it can be optimized for size.
     - debian/control: Build-Depends: debhelper (>= 7.3.0).

     - debian/README.source: Add instructions for regenerating upstream
       changelog file.

    /usr/share/doc/xz-utils.

xz-utils (4.999.8beta-1) experimental; urgency=low

  [ Jonathan Nieder ]
  * Initial package for Debian. (Closes: #518803)
     + debian/rules:
        - add minimal rules file (using Debhelper 7), a control file
          describing the binary packages, and an appropriate compat file.
        - use configure --enable-dynamic; use up-to-date config.guess and
          config.sub files.
        - do not run automake and so on on autobuilders. Instead, we can
          run them ourselves when we build the source package.
     + debian/README.source:
        - add informations about the packaging GIT repository.
  * Add liblzma-doc package with Doxygen-generated API docs.

  [ Mohammed Adnène Trojette ]
  * Prepare for upload to experimental.
